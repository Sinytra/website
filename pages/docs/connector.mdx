## üìñ About

**Sinytra Connector** is a translation/compatibility layer that allows running [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mods on [MinecraftForge](https://minecraftforge.net/).
Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving developers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once,
as well as allowing players to play all their favourite mods in one modpack.

## üì¶ Installation

<Callout type="info">
  Do not download the original Fabric API, as it's substitued by the **Forgified Fabric API**.
</Callout>

Connector's installation procedure follows the standard steps used for installing Minecraft mods. It runs on the MinecraftForge mod loader
and depends only on the Forgified Fabric API. If you're not familiar with this process, we've listed the exact steps below:

1. Install **Minecraft Forge**. For Minecraft 1.20.1, we recommend using version **47.1.3**.
2. Download the **Forgified Fabric API**. It is meant to be a direct *replacement* for the Fabric API and is not compatible with it.
   We'll try our best to avoid loading the Fabric API if it's installed automatically (e.g. by your modpack manager),
   but if you have the option to avoid installing it, please do so.
3. Install Connector. Get the latest release from one of our official distribution channels and drop the jar in your `mods` folder.

üéâ With all the steps completed, you're good to go! With all dependencies installed, grab your favourite Fabric mods and just
**drop them in the mods folder** like you would with any Forge mods. Connector will handle loading them for you with no additional steps required.
