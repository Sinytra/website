# Sinytra
Sinytra provides different libraries that allow running Fabric mods on NeoForge.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="🚧">
  The documentation is under construction and may not be complete.
</Callout>

## Get started
To get started, you should download [Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) and [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) and
place them in the `mods` folder.

<Callout type="info">
  Do not download Fabric API as it's not needed when you have Forgified Fabric API.
</Callout>

Then, simply install your Fabric mods in the `mods` folder, and profit!

<Callout type="error" emoji="🐛">
  If you notice any bugs or you encounter incompatibilities **DO NOT** report them to the mod authors.
  Instead, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mamk7z3TKZ) for support or report the issue on our [issue
  tracker](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/issues).
