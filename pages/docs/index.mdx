## üëã Introduction

Sinytra creates high-quality tools related to cross-platform Minecraft modding.
We aim to enhance users' experience by bringing mod loaders closer together, allowing them to enjoy playing all the mods they love.
By utilizing our libraries, developers can now spend less time porting their mods and focus more on development itself.

Whether you're a player or a developer, we've got you covered! Take a look at an overview of our projects below.

## üéÆ For users

### Connector - run Fabric mods on Forge! [#connector]

Connector is a translation/compatibility layer that allows running [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mods on [MinecraftForge](https://minecraftforge.net/).
Its goal is to bring the two platforms closer together, saving developers time and effort maintaining their mods for multiple platforms at once,
as well as allowing players to play all their favourite mods in one modpack.

[Get started](/docs/connector) using Connector.

### Connector Extras - improved compatiblity [#connector-extras]

An accompanying mod for Connector that adds integration with third-party APIs and mods.
It is divided into several submodules for each type of integration.

Example compatibility modules include:

- Team Reborn Energy API Bridge
- JEI / REI / EMI Plugin Platform Bridge
- Reach Entity Attributes - Forge port
- Forge Config API Port - Forge bridge
- KubeJS Bridge

More information about Connector Extras is available [here](https://github.com/Sinytra/ConnectorExtras).

## üõ†Ô∏è For developers

### Forgified Fabric API

The Forgified Fabric API (FFAPI) is a **direct port** of Fabric API to Minecraft Forge, regularly kept up to date with the upstream repository.

It is designed to make cross-platform mod development easier by allowing developers to use Fabric API as a common library to interact with the
game's code on both platforms.
However, it is not an abstraction layer, and loader-specific code still needs to be handled separately for each platform.

Interested in developing mods using FFAPI? Head over to the [documentation](/docs/forgified-fabric-api).

### Mixin Transmogrifier

> Mixin Booster - ü¶Ä SpüßΩnge Mixin Ultimate ‚ö° Exterminator ‚ò†Ô∏è MK2 ++ (strong effect) ü¶Ä

<Callout type="info">
  Starting 1.20.4, NeoForge comes with the Fabric fork of Mixin by default, making the use of Mixin Transmogrifier no longer necessary.
</Callout>

This project replaces Sponge's (classic) Mixin which is used by (Neo)Forge with Fabric's version that has more features (e.g. interface and constructor injections).

You can find more details in our blog post on [The state of Mixins on (Neo)Forge](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector/discussions/383).
