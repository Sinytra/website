# Sharing launcher logs
Sometimes your game may crash, but it will not have any indication of doing so in the `latest.log` nor the `debug.log` file.
To be able to debug the issue and see which mod is causing it, you need to check the launcher logs to have access to the entire console logging.

Below you will find instructions on accessing the console logs in different launchers.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We recommend sharing logs through [Gist](https://gist.github.com/).
  While there are specialised websites for Minecraft for sharing logs (such as [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/)) they have needless
  browser overhead and provide highlighting that can make reading the logs worse. We can help you more easily debug issues with the raw log.
